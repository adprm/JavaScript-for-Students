# JavaScript-Array

Data structure is a method or method used to store data in computer memory.<br>
One data structure that is often used in programming is Array.<br>
Arrays are data structures that are used to store a set of data in one place.<br>
Every data in an Array has an index, so we will easily process it.<br>

# Basic writing of arrays
Array of one data type<br>
`var exampleArrayData = ['Pulpen', 'Pensil', 'Buku'];`

Array of many data types<br>
`var exampleArrayData2 = [15, 4.5, true, 'A', 'Indonesia'];`

Get data array
```
var exampleArrayData = ['Pulpen', 'Pensil', 'Buku'];
exampleArrayData2[2];  //Buku
```
