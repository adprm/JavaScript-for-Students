# JavaScript-DOM

DOM stands for Document Object Model.<br>
That is, documents (HTML) that are modeled in an object.<br>
The object of this document provides a set of functions and attributes / data<br>
that we can use in making a Javascript program. This is what is called an API (Application Programming Interface).
